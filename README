DEPENDENCIES
************

Organdiae's sole dependency is Python.
It runs for sure on the following distributions:
	* Python 2.6
	* Jython 2.5

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES
*********************

For Organdiae to make any sense at all, you should have GraphViz and
GNUPlot installed.

GraphViz: http://www.graphviz.org
GNUPlot: http://www.gnuplot.info

Organdiae will run fine without these programs, but will lack the ability
to render visualizations and you will have to work solely out of the
terminal.

Additionally, to view the svgs generated by Organdiae's GraphViz backend,
we recommend using, Firefox, as it provides the best SVG support of any
major browser.

DOCUMENTATION
*************

Assuming that you've acquired a complete release of organdiae, its
documentation is in a subdirectory of this directory called `./doc'.
The homepage for the documentation is index.html.  Additionally,
you may find said documentation on http://www.organdiae.com/doc . 

If this is your first time using organdiae, we recommend that you start
by clicking on the link "Organdiae in Six Concepts", which explains its
core functionality as well as the reasons for which it was created.
Then, browse through the tutorials for some ideas on how to use organdiae.

INSTALLATION
************

To install, type at the command line:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

The former builds organdiae, and the latter installs it into your python
directory.  After this, you can dispense with the present folder unless you
want to guard the docs or the source code.  The documentation can also be
found online at www.organdiae.com .

Alternatively, you can use the traditional:

make
make install
make clean # optional

This is simply a wrapper for the python build and install mechanism.
There is no config file.
