INSTALLATION
************

To install, type at the command line:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

The former builds organdiae, and the latter installs it into your python
directory.  After this, you can dispense with the present folder unless you
want to guard the docs or the source code.  The documentation can also be
found online at www.organdiae.com .

Alternatively, you can use the traditional:

make
make install
make clean # optional

This is simply a wrapper for the python build and install mechanism.
There is no config file.
