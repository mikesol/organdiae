CFunction and Collections
********************************

This module provides a class called ``CFunction`` that allows the ``Crawler`` to move along Edge buses as well as a ``Collection`` class that provides a trivial implementation of a CFunction return value (it is used to implement ``Tags`` in the :doc:`standard bootstrap <bootstrap>`).  Uses of CFunction can be seen in the following documents: :doc:`quickguide` and :doc:`concepts`.
