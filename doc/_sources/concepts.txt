********************************
Organdiae in Six Concepts
********************************

The following presents six concepts [#f1]_ around which Organdiae is designed.  The order of presentation is mostly to create cliffhangers between the sections, although there is probably some hierarchical logic at play too.

.. toctree::

	concepts1
	concepts2
	concepts3
	concepts4
	concepts5
	concepts6
	conclusion

Before reading these documents, if you are not familiar with Python, read `this <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>`_ first.  Organdiae will be of little practical value to you if you do not feel comfortable in the Python interpreter.
