A dissertating PhD student, you have been so busy writing your thesis that you've forgotten to compose for almost a year.  Eager to get back into the game, you see a competition for string trio and decide that, in spite of the fact that the deadline is in two weeks, you are going to enter it.  You sit down to write a piece, but nothing comes out.  Having heard about Organdiae from a friend, you download it, install it, and start a Python session with all of the ideas you have so far ::

	>>> from organdiae import *
	>>> bs('trio')
	>>> g = DiGraph()
	>>> for x in ['violin','viola','cello', 'plays','trio'] :
	... 	ng(x, name=True)
	... 
	<class 'organdiae.core.core.violin'>
	<class 'organdiae.core.core.viola'>
	<class 'organdiae.core.core.cello'>
	<class 'organdiae.core.core.plays'>
	<class 'organdiae.core.core.trio'>
	>>> g.ae(violin,trio,sb(plays))
	>>> g.ae(viola,trio,sb(plays))
	>>> g.ae(cello,trio,sb(plays))
	>>> gv(g,path='ratherLimited')

Well, that didn't help much.  To overcome this creative impasse, you decide to:

* Start writing :doc:`algorithms <deadline2>` and see where that takes you.
* Start at the :doc:`first bar <deadline3>` and see what comes out.
